      "p1": "Aperto is an open-source Bible translation project written for modern readers—whether you're a lifelong believer wanting fresh eyes on familiar texts, or a sceptic curious what these ancient texts actually say.",
      "p2": "The name comes from Latin 'apertus': open, accessible, unconcealed. It's inspired by Luke 24:32, where the disciples say their hearts burned within them as Jesus opened the Scriptures to them."

      "ecumenicalDesc": "Our approach integrates Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, and Pentecostal scholarship fairly—not flattened into one tradition. We also engage with feminist, liberationist, and historical-critical readings, aware of how translations have historically been used to both liberate and harm.",

    "theological": {
      "title": "A Theological Justification",
      "p1": "When Jesus said 'I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out' (Luke 19:40), he was responding to religious leaders who wanted to silence the proclamation of who he was. His point: if the expected voices fall silent, God will use unexpected means.",
      "p2": "We don't claim AI is literally the 'stones crying out'. But we do believe that when traditional gatekeepers can't or won't make Scripture accessible to everyone, God's message will find other ways through.",
      "p3": "There's a certain poetry to it: silicon chips are, after all, rocks we taught to think. Sand refined, etched with circuits, trained on humanity's collected wisdom. If God can speak through a burning bush, a donkey, or bread and wine—perhaps silicon isn't so strange a medium.",
      "poetry": "Silicon chips are rocks we taught to think. Sand refined, etched with circuits, trained on humanity's collected wisdom.",
      "p4": "The printing press was once viewed with suspicion by religious authorities. So was translating the Bible into vernacular languages. Every technological shift that democratised access to Scripture was initially resisted—and eventually embraced."
