        <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed" style="color: #5A5A5A;">
          <strong style="color: #2C2C2C;">Aperto</strong> (from Latin <em>apertus</em>: open, accessible) is an open-source Bible translation project based in Berlin. We're writing for believers who want fresh eyes on familiar texts—and skeptics who are curious what all the fuss is about. Whether you're deeply rooted in faith, exploring from the outside, or somewhere in between, you're welcome here.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl mt-12 mb-6 headline-mixed">A European Project</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed" style="color: #5A5A5A;">
          Most accessible Bible translations come from American evangelical contexts. They work well for their intended audiences but can feel culturally foreign to European readers—particularly those outside church communities.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed" style="color: #5A5A5A;">
          Aperto is shaped by the European context: post-Christian, pluralistic, and culturally diverse. Our approach is ecumenical—drawing on Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, and Pentecostal perspectives—and intersectional, aware of how translations have historically been used to both liberate and harm. We engage with contemporary biblical scholarship—including feminist, postcolonial, and social-historical readings—not as ideological positions but because readers deserve intellectual honesty about how interpretation works.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl mt-12 mb-6 headline-mixed">Why Another Translation?</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed" style="color: #5A5A5A;">
          Most Bible translations fall into two camps: scholarly accuracy (hard to read) or evangelical accessibility (loaded with insider language). Aperto takes a third path: literary quality that welcomes everyone.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed" style="color: #5A5A5A;">
          We write for the person who reads contemporary fiction, watches quality documentaries, and is curious about ancient texts—whether they're lifelong believers wanting fresh perspective or skeptics wondering what these texts actually say.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl mt-12 mb-6 headline-mixed">Translation Philosophy</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4" style="color: #5A5A5A;">
          Our approach balances accessibility, scholarly depth, and ecumenical breadth:
        </p>
        <ul class="space-y-3 list-disc list-inside" style="color: #5A5A5A;">
          <li><strong style="color: #2C2C2C;">No insider vocabulary:</strong> Everyday words that don't require religious background.</li>
          <li><strong style="color: #2C2C2C;">Literary quality:</strong> Written to match contemporary fiction standards.</li>
          <li><strong style="color: #2C2C2C;">Honest footnotes:</strong> Cultural context, Greek word studies, multiple interpretive options, and acknowledgment of difficult passages.</li>
          <li><strong style="color: #2C2C2C;">Ecumenical foundations:</strong> Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, and Pentecostal scholarship represented fairly—not flattened into one tradition.</li>
          <li><strong style="color: #2C2C2C;">Diverse scholarship:</strong> Drawing on feminist, liberationist, and historical-critical readings alongside traditional commentaries.</li>
          <li><strong style="color: #2C2C2C;">Multimedia first:</strong> Audio Bible, podcasts, songs, and contemplative practices—meeting people where they are.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl mt-12 mb-6 headline-mixed">The Name</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed" style="color: #5A5A5A;">
          Aperto comes from Latin <em>apertus</em>: open, accessible, unconcealed. It's inspired by Luke 24:32, where the disciples say their hearts burned within them as Jesus "opened" the Scriptures to them.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl mt-12 mb-6 headline-mixed">Languages</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed" style="color: #5A5A5A;">
          Currently available in English, German, French, Polish, and Turkish. Each translation is culturally adapted for its context—not just linguistically translated but reimagined for how people in Berlin, Paris, Warsaw, or Istanbul might encounter these texts.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl mt-12 mb-6 headline-mixed">License</h2>
