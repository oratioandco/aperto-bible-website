## Overview

Luke chapter 1 forms the theological and literary overture to Luke's two-volume work (Luke-Acts). Written in a sophisticated literary style that shifts from classical Greek prologue to Septuagintal Hebrew poetry, this chapter introduces the major themes that will unfold throughout the narrative: God's faithfulness to his promises, the reversal of social hierarchies, the role of the Spirit, and salvation reaching the margins of society.

The chapter divides into eight pericopes:
1. **1:1-4** — Prologue: Why I'm Writing This
2. **1:5-25** — An Old Priest, an Empty Nursery
3. **1:26-38** — Mary Says Yes
4. **1:39-45** — Two Women, Two Miracles
5. **1:46-56** — Mary's Song (Magnificat)
6. **1:57-66** — His Name Is John
7. **1:67-79** — Zechariah's Prophecy (Benedictus)
8. **1:80** — Growing Up in the Wilderness

## Pericope 1: Prologue (1:1-4)

### Greek Text

> Ἐπειδήπερ πολλοὶ ἐπεχείρησαν ἀνατάξασθαι διήγησιν περὶ τῶν πεπληροφορημένων ἐν ἡμῖν πραγμάτων, καθὼς παρέδοσαν ἡμῖν οἱ ἀπʼ ἀρχῆς αὐτόπται καὶ ὑπηρέται γενόμενοι τοῦ λόγου, ἔδοξε κἀμοὶ παρηκολουθηκότι ἄνωθεν πᾶσιν ἀκριβῶς καθεξῆς σοι γράψαι, κράτιστε Θεόφιλε, ἵνα ἐπιγνῷς περὶ ὧν κατηχήθης λόγων τὴν ἀσφάλειαν.

### Literary Form
Historical-literary prologue in classical Greek style

### Translation Considerations

**Key Terms for Unchurched Readers:**
- **πεπληροφορημένων** (peplērophorēmenōn): "fulfilled" or "accomplished" — events that have reached their intended completion. Not just "things that happened" but things that complete a larger purpose.
- **αὐτόπται** (autoptai): "eyewitnesses" — technical term for firsthand observers; the root of our word "autopsy" (seeing for oneself).
- **κατηχήθης** (katēchēthēs): "instructed" — oral teaching passed down; root of "catechism." Theophilus has received prior teaching that Luke now confirms in writing.
- **ἀσφάλειαν** (asphaleian): "certainty/reliability" — not blind faith, but well-grounded confidence based on evidence.

### Commentary Synthesis

**Fitzmyer (Anchor Bible):** The prologue is one sentence in Greek, following conventions of Hellenistic historiography (cf. Josephus, Philo). Luke positions himself among other writers about Jesus but claims superiority through his method: careful investigation (παρηκολουθηκότι) from the beginning (ἄνωθεν), systematic arrangement (καθεξῆς), and precision (ἀκριβῶς).

**Bovon (Hermeneia):** The prologue functions as a literary contract with readers. By using classical Greek (the only such passage in Luke-Acts), Luke signals he's writing serious history, not popular legend. The transition to Septuagintal style in v.5 is deliberately jarring—Luke can write like a Greek historian but chooses to tell this story in the language of Israel's scriptures.

**Bock (Baker):** The term "eyewitnesses and servants of the word" (αὐτόπται καὶ ὑπηρέται τοῦ λόγου) is crucial—these are two descriptions of the same people, not two groups. The apostolic generation both saw the events and became ministers of the message.

### Cultural Context

- **Theophilus**: Either a real patron (κράτιστε is a title for Roman officials) or a symbolic "lover of God" (θεός + φίλος). Ancient books required wealthy patrons for copying and distribution.
- **Historiographical Conventions**: Compare Josephus, *Against Apion* 1.1-3; Herodotus 1.1. Luke claims the same standards as respected historians.
- **"Many have undertaken"**: Not a criticism of other accounts (Mark, Q) but acknowledgment that this tradition matters enough to be told multiple ways.

### Emotional Arc
The prologue establishes *intellectual confidence*—this is not myth or legend but carefully investigated history that can be trusted.

### Translation Notes for Aperto Bible
- Avoid "Gospel" in translation—Luke calls it a διήγησις (narrative/account)
- "Certainty" is better than "truth" for ἀσφάλεια—emphasizes reliability of the account, not abstract philosophical truth
- The formal Greek should feel slightly elevated in translation, then shift to warmer, more biblical tone at v.5

## Pericope 2: An Old Priest, an Empty Nursery (1:5-25)

### Greek Text (selected key verses)

> v.5: Ἐγένετο ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις Ἡρῴδου βασιλέως τῆς Ἰουδαίας ἱερεύς τις ὀνόματι Ζαχαρίας ἐξ ἐφημερίας Ἀβιά, καὶ γυνὴ αὐτῷ ἐκ τῶν θυγατέρων Ἀαρὼν καὶ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῆς Ἐλισάβετ.

> v.7: καὶ οὐκ ἦν αὐτοῖς τέκνον, καθότι ⸀ἦν ἡ Ἐλισάβετ στεῖρα, καὶ ἀμφότεροι προβεβηκότες ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτῶν ἦσαν.

> v.13: εἶπεν δὲ πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁ ἄγγελος· Μὴ φοβοῦ, Ζαχαρία, διότι εἰσηκούσθη ἡ δέησίς σου, καὶ ἡ γυνή σου Ἐλισάβετ γεννήσει υἱόν σοι, καὶ καλέσεις τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰωάννην.

### Literary Form
Birth annunciation narrative (compare Judges 13, Genesis 18, 1 Samuel 1)

### Translation Considerations

**Key Terms for Unchurched Readers:**
- **ἐφημερία** (ephēmeria): priestly "division" or "rotation" — one of 24 groups that took turns serving in the temple (1 Chronicles 24:7-18). Abijah was the eighth division.
- **στεῖρα** (steira): "barren" — more than medical infertility; in this culture, a social catastrophe that implied divine disfavor (though Luke immediately counters this: they were "righteous before God").
- **δέησις** (deēsis): "prayer/petition" — specifically a prayer of request, implying Zechariah had been praying for a child despite his age.
- **θυμίαμα** (thymiama): "incense" — burned on a special altar inside the sanctuary, a once-in-a-lifetime privilege for most priests.

### Commentary Synthesis

**Fitzmyer (Anchor Bible):** The sudden shift to Septuagintal Greek in v.5 signals we're entering the world of Israel's scriptures. "In the days of Herod" is both historical marker and theological irony—this tyrant's days are numbered, for the true king is coming. Elizabeth's priestly lineage ("daughters of Aaron") makes John's pedigree impeccable on both sides.

**Bovon (Hermeneia):** The annunciation follows a five-part pattern from Hebrew Bible: (1) appearance of angel, (2) fear, (3) message with name and destiny, (4) objection, (5) sign. Zechariah's doubt differs from Abraham's or Gideon's only in context—this revelation surpasses all previous ones, so a harsher sign is given.

**Bock (Baker):** The detail that Zechariah was "righteous before God" (v.6) is crucial—their childlessness is NOT divine punishment. Luke demolishes prosperity-gospel thinking from the start. Sometimes the most faithful people suffer the most painful circumstances.

**Feminist Studies (Meyers):** Elizabeth's barrenness evokes Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, Hannah, and Samson's mother—a lineage of "impossible" mothers through whom God worked. Her five-month seclusion (v.24) may reflect both ritual purity concerns and simple prudence for an elderly first pregnancy.

### Cultural Context

**Temple Service:**
- ~18,000 priests existed, divided into 24 courses serving two weeks annually
- The incense offering occurred twice daily (morning and evening sacrifice)
- A priest might receive this honor only once in his lifetime—it was chosen by lot
- The priest entered the Holy Place alone; the people waited outside praying
- An extended delay would cause anxiety (had he died? offended God?)

**Barrenness in Ancient Mediterranean:**
- Economically devastating (no support in old age)
- Socially shameful (assumptions of divine punishment)
- Grounds for divorce under Jewish law—that Zechariah stayed shows deep love
- "Advanced in years" (v.7) suggests over 60—beyond natural hope

**Gabriel:**
- One of only two angels named in Hebrew Bible (Daniel 8:16, 9:21; Michael is the other)
- Associated with interpreting divine mysteries and announcing future events
- "Standing in God's presence" indicates highest angelic rank

### Emotional Arc
The pericope moves from **quiet grief** (an elderly couple's private sorrow) through **terror** (the supernatural intrusion) to **silenced hope** (Zechariah struck dumb but carrying a promise). The emotional weight is on the long years of prayer finally answered—but in a way that exceeds all expectation.

### Translation Notes for Aperto Bible
- "Blameless" (v.6) should not suggest sinless perfection—"They lived their lives in a way God approved" captures the sense
- The temple vocabulary needs brief explanation for secular readers who have no frame of reference
- Zechariah's muteness is both punishment and sign—his silence protects the secret until the proper time
- Elizabeth's statement (v.25) about "disgrace among people" makes explicit what the culture assumed about barrenness

## Pericope 3: Mary Says Yes (1:26-38)

### Greek Text (selected key verses)

> v.28: καὶ εἰσελθὼν πρὸς αὐτὴν εἶπεν· Χαῖρε, κεχαριτωμένη, ὁ κύριος μετὰ σοῦ.

> v.35: καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ ἄγγελος εἶπεν αὐτῇ· Πνεῦμα ἅγιον ἐπελεύσεται ἐπὶ σέ, καὶ δύναμις ὑψίστου ἐπισκιάσει σοι· διὸ καὶ τὸ γεννώμενον ἅγιον κληθήσεται υἱὸς θεοῦ.

> v.38: εἶπεν δὲ Μαριάμ· Ἰδοὺ ἡ δούλη κυρίου· γένοιτό μοι κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμά σου. καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἀπʼ αὐτῆς ὁ ἄγγελος.

### Literary Form
Annunciation narrative with call narrative elements (Mary is called to a vocation)

### Translation Considerations

**Key Terms for Unchurched Readers:**

- **κεχαριτωμένη** (kecharitōmenē): "favored one" or "graced one" — perfect passive participle indicating completed action with ongoing effects. NOT "full of grace" (Vulgate's gratia plena) but "one whom God has favored." 
  - BDAG: "one who has been favored (by God)"
  - Louw-Nida (88.66): "to show kindness to someone, with the implication of graciousness on the part of the one showing such kindness"

- **ἐπισκιάσει** (episkiasei): "will overshadow" — the verb evokes God's presence "overshadowing" the tabernacle (Exodus 40:35) and the cloud on the mount of transfiguration. NOT sexual imagery.
  - BDAG: "This perspective is present in the account of Mary's unique conception δύναμις ὑψίστου ἐπισκιάσει σοι"
  - Louw-Nida (14.62): "In Lk 1:35 ἐπισκιάζω is used figuratively in speaking of the agency of the Holy Spirit... A strictly literal rendering could be interpreted in some languages as being a rather crude reference to sexual intercourse, and this interpretation should be avoided."

- **δούλη** (doulē): "female slave/servant" — Mary uses the strongest term of submission. In OT tradition, being God's "servant" is an honor (Abraham, Moses, David, prophets).

- **γένοιτό μοι** (genoito moi): "let it be to me" — optative mood expressing wish/consent. Mary's response is active consent, not passive resignation.

### Commentary Synthesis

**Fitzmyer (Anchor Bible):** The annunciation to Mary deliberately parallels and surpasses the annunciation to Zechariah. Both receive angelic visitors, both are troubled, both receive "do not fear," both ask questions. But Mary's question ("How can this be?") differs from Zechariah's doubt ("How shall I know?")—she seeks understanding, not proof. Her response echoes the prophetic call pattern: she is commissioned for a task.

**Bovon (Hermeneia):** The christological titles accumulate: "great," "Son of the Most High," "throne of David," "king over Jacob forever," "holy," "Son of God." Luke front-loads his highest christology into this pre-birth announcement. The "eternal kingdom" echoes Daniel 7:14 and 2 Samuel 7:12-16.

**Bock (Baker):** Mary's question (v.34) is not doubt but practical inquiry—she's asking about mechanism, not possibility. The angel's response (v.35) is the most explicit statement of Jesus' divine origin in the Synoptics. "Holy Spirit" and "power of the Most High" are parallel expressions, not two distinct entities.

**Feminist Studies (D'Angelo, Meyers):** 
- Mary's age: likely 12-14, the typical betrothal age for Jewish girls
- Her social status: essentially nil (young, female, from insignificant Nazareth)
- Her agency: Luke emphasizes Mary's consent—this is not divine rape (contrast Greek mythology). Her "yes" is theologically essential.
- "Slave of the Lord" (δούλη κυρίου): paradoxically both humble submission and prophetic dignity

### Cultural Context

**Nazareth:**
- A tiny village (500-2000 inhabitants) of no significance
- Not mentioned in Hebrew Bible, Josephus, or Talmud
- Archaeological evidence shows agricultural workers, some poverty
- The contrast with royal Davidic promises is deliberate irony

**Betrothal (μνηστευμένην):**
- Legally binding contract, usually arranged between families
- Typically lasted about a year before marriage
- Sexual relations forbidden during betrothal
- Breaking betrothal required formal divorce
- Pregnancy during betrothal was adultery—capital offense (Deuteronomy 22:23-24)

**"Virgin" (παρθένος):**
- Greek term indicates both age (young unmarried woman) and sexual status
- Luke 1:34 makes the sexual meaning explicit: "I have not known a man"
- Isaiah 7:14 LXX uses παρθένος, creating the prophetic connection

**Divine Conception:**
- Pagan parallels (Zeus and mortal women) involve physical intercourse
- Luke's account is explicitly non-sexual: Spirit "comes upon," power "overshadows"
- Language echoes Exodus 40:35 (cloud covering tabernacle), not pagan theogamy
- Mary becomes a new "tent of meeting" where God dwells

### Emotional Arc
The pericope moves from **ordinary life** (a village girl, betrothed) through **overwhelming intrusion** (an angel with impossible news) to **courageous surrender** ("let it be to me"). Mary's final words are not passive acceptance but active embrace of a dangerous vocation.

### Translation Notes for Aperto Bible
- "Favored one" is better than "full of grace"—emphasizes God's initiative, not Mary's inherent quality
- "Overshadow" needs careful handling—evokes presence, protection, power, not sexuality
- Mary's consent should feel active and brave, not meek resignation
- The Davidic promises (throne, kingdom forever) connect to Jewish messianic hope—unfamiliar to secular readers
- "Son of God" here is functional/messianic, not ontological trinitarian theology (though Luke would affirm both)

## Pericope 4: Two Women, Two Miracles (1:39-45)

### Greek Text (selected key verses)

> v.41: καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσεν τὸν ἀσπασμὸν τῆς Μαρίας ἡ Ἐλισάβετ, ἐσκίρτησεν τὸ βρέφος ἐν τῇ κοιλίᾳ αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐπλήσθη πνεύματος ἁγίου ἡ Ἐλισάβετ

> v.42: καὶ ἀνεφώνησεν κραυγῇ μεγάλῃ καὶ εἶπεν· Εὐλογημένη σὺ ἐν γυναιξὶν καὶ εὐλογημένος ὁ καρπὸς τῆς κοιλίας σου.

> v.45: καὶ μακαρία ἡ πιστεύσασα ὅτι ἔσται τελείωσις τοῖς λελαλημένοις αὐτῇ παρὰ κυρίου.

### Literary Form
Recognition scene / prophetic encounter

### Translation Considerations

**Key Terms for Unchurched Readers:**

- **ἐσκίρτησεν** (eskirtēsen): "leaped" — strong physical movement, associated with joy and dancing (cf. Malachi 4:2 LXX). The fetus recognizes what the adults cannot yet see.

- **ἀνεφώνησεν κραυγῇ μεγάλῃ** (anephōnēsen kraugē megalē): "cried out with a loud shout" — not a whisper but a prophetic declaration. Elizabeth becomes the first human to proclaim Jesus' significance.

- **εὐλογημένη** (eulogēmenē): "blessed" — passive, indicating God's action: "you whom God has blessed." Different from μακαρία in v.45.

- **μακαρία** (makaria): "blessed/happy/fortunate" — describes the result of right action or right relation to God. Often translated "happy" but deeper than mere happiness.

- **τελείωσις** (teleiōsis): "fulfillment/completion" — the promises will reach their intended goal.

### Commentary Synthesis

**Fitzmyer (Anchor Bible):** Elizabeth's blessing has two parts: Mary is blessed among women (human perspective) and the fruit of her womb is blessed (divine perspective). The phrase "mother of my Lord" (v.43) is remarkable—Elizabeth recognizes Mary's child as her own Lord, even before birth. This is the highest christological confession in the infancy narrative.

**Bovon (Hermeneia):** The scene depicts two marginal women—one too old, one too young—becoming the first prophets of the new age. John's movement in the womb is not mere fetal activity but prophetic recognition: the forerunner acknowledges the Messiah. Elizabeth's filling with the Spirit parallels Zechariah's (v.67) and anticipates Pentecost.

**Bock (Baker):** The contrast with Zechariah is complete: he doubted and was silenced; Mary believed and is pronounced blessed (μακαρία). Faith, not status, determines one's role in God's purposes.

**Feminist Studies:** This is a scene of female solidarity and prophetic recognition. Two pregnant women, alone together, share revelations that the men in their lives cannot yet understand. Elizabeth validates Mary's impossible story—crucial social support for a young woman in a dangerous situation.

### Cultural Context

**The Journey:**
- Nazareth to "hill country of Judea" (probably near Jerusalem): 80-100 miles
- Travel time: 3-5 days, depending on pace and route
- A young woman traveling alone was unusual and risky (bandits, propriety concerns)
- Mary likely traveled with others (caravan, family group)

**The Meeting:**
- Greeting (ἀσπασμός) was ritualized blessing, not casual "hello"
- The fetal response was believed significant—babies were thought to sense important events
- "Leaping" (σκιρτάω) connects to prophecy of John's prenatal Spirit-filling (1:15)

**"Mother of my Lord":**
- Elizabeth calls Mary the mother of her κύριος (Lord)
- In LXX, κύριος translates YHWH—divine name
- Elizabeth thus implicitly recognizes the divine status of Mary's unborn child
- This is startling: an older, respected woman honoring a young, socially vulnerable girl

### Emotional Arc
The pericope moves from **urgency** (Mary's hasty journey) through **explosive recognition** (John leaps, Elizabeth shouts) to **profound validation** ("Blessed are you... blessed is she who believed"). For Mary, alone with her secret, this is the first human confirmation that she has not imagined everything.

### Translation Notes for Aperto Bible
- "Blessed" appears three times with slightly different nuances—find varied English expressions
- Elizabeth's "shout" should feel prophetic, not hysterical
- "Mother of my Lord" is the theological climax—Mary is recognized before Jesus is born
- The scene's intimacy (two women, private space, shared secrets) should come through

## Pericope 5: Mary's Song / Magnificat (1:46-56)

### Greek Text

> v.46-47: Καὶ εἶπεν Μαριάμ· Μεγαλύνει ἡ ψυχή μου τὸν κύριον, καὶ ἠγαλλίασεν τὸ πνεῦμά μου ἐπὶ τῷ θεῷ τῷ σωτῆρί μου,

> v.48: ὅτι ἐπέβλεψεν ἐπὶ τὴν ταπείνωσιν τῆς δούλης αὐτοῦ. ἰδοὺ γὰρ ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν μακαριοῦσίν με πᾶσαι αἱ γενεαί,

> v.51-53: Ἐποίησεν κράτος ἐν βραχίονι αὐτοῦ, διεσκόρπισεν ὑπερηφάνους διανοίᾳ καρδίας αὐτῶν· καθεῖλεν δυνάστας ἀπὸ θρόνων καὶ ὕψωσεν ταπεινούς, πεινῶντας ἐνέπλησεν ἀγαθῶν καὶ πλουτοῦντας ἐξαπέστειλεν κενούς.

### Literary Form
Hymn/psalm of praise; prophetic poetry

### Translation Considerations

**Key Terms for Unchurched Readers:**

- **Μεγαλύνει** (megalynei): "magnifies/declares great" — not making God bigger but proclaiming God's greatness
  - BDAG: "to praise a person in terms of that individual's greatness"
  - Louw-Nida (33.358): "to praise a person in terms of that individual's greatness—'to praise the greatness of'"

- **ταπείνωσιν** (tapeinōsin): "lowliness/humble state" — not humility as virtue but low social status
  - BDAG: "an unpretentious state or condition, lowliness, humility, humble station... ἐπιβλέπειν ἐπὶ τὴν ταπ. τινος look upon someone's humble station i.e. show concern for someone in humble circumstances Lk 1:48"

- **δυνάστας** (dynastas): "rulers/powerful ones" — those who hold power over others
  - BDAG: "of humans... καθαιρεῖν δ. ἀπὸ θρόνων dethrone rulers Lk 1:52 (cp. Job 12:19)"

- **ταπεινούς** (tapeinous): "the lowly/humble" — those of low social status, the insignificant

- **διεσκόρπισεν** (dieskorpisen): "scattered" — military term for routing an army

### Commentary Synthesis

**Fitzmyer (Anchor Bible):** The Magnificat is structured in two parts: vv.46-50 (personal praise for what God has done for Mary) and vv.51-55 (communal praise for God's pattern of action in history). The aorist tenses in vv.51-55 are "prophetic aorists"—describing future events as if already accomplished. The song weaves together phrases from Hannah's song (1 Samuel 2:1-10), Psalms, and prophetic literature.

**Bovon (Hermeneia):** Some manuscripts attribute the song to Elizabeth, and there's scholarly debate about the original speaker. Regardless, Luke presents it as Mary's prophecy—a young woman's vision of divine revolution. The social reversals (proud/humble, rulers/lowly, rich/hungry) are not metaphorical but programmatic for Luke's entire Gospel.

**Bock (Baker):** The Magnificat reveals Mary as a theologian. She interprets her personal experience through the lens of salvation history and God's covenant promises. Her song anticipates Jesus' Nazareth manifesto (4:18-19) and the Beatitudes (6:20-26).

**Feminist Studies (D'Angelo):** The Magnificat has been called "the most revolutionary document in the world." A peasant girl proclaims the overthrow of the powerful and the elevation of the powerless. Liberation theologians have embraced it; some governments have banned its public reading. Mary speaks not as passive vessel but as prophetic voice announcing God's preferential option for the poor.

### Cultural Context

**Hannah's Song (1 Samuel 2:1-10):**
The primary intertext. Compare:
- "My soul rejoices in the Lord" (1 Sam 2:1) / "My soul magnifies the Lord" (Lk 1:46)
- The barren bears seven (1 Sam 2:5) / God looks on the lowly (Lk 1:48)
- The Lord brings low and exalts (1 Sam 2:7) / God brings down rulers, lifts up lowly (Lk 1:52)
- The hungry are filled (1 Sam 2:5) / God fills the hungry (Lk 1:53)

**The "Great Reversal":**
A consistent Lukan theme:
- First will be last, last first (13:30)
- Exalt yourself and be humbled, humble yourself and be exalted (14:11; 18:14)
- Blessed are you poor... woe to you rich (6:20, 24)
- The story of Lazarus and the rich man (16:19-31)

**Historical Resonance:**
- In 1980s Latin America, military governments banned the Magnificat's public recitation
- It remains a text of liberation theology and social justice movements
- Some scholars distinguish between spiritual and material meanings; Luke refuses this distinction

### Emotional Arc
The Magnificat moves from **intimate wonder** (God noticed me!) through **expanding vision** (God's mercy reaches across generations) to **cosmic upheaval** (thrones toppled, power structures inverted). The emotional register shifts from personal gratitude to prophetic fire.

### Translation Notes for Aperto Bible
- "Magnifies" is archaic; consider "My whole being declares how great the Lord is" or "I sing out how great God is"
- The aorist verbs (scattered, brought down, filled, sent away) describe accomplished facts, not wishes—translate with confidence
- Don't spiritualize the reversals: Luke means economic and political transformation, not just inner attitude change
- "Lowliness" (ταπείνωσις) is social status, not piety—Mary is poor, young, female, from a nothing village
- The song should feel revolutionary, not sentimental

## Pericope 6: His Name Is John (1:57-66)

### Greek Text (selected key verses)

> v.59: Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ὀγδόῃ ἦλθον περιτεμεῖν τὸ παιδίον καὶ ἐκάλουν αὐτὸ ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ Ζαχαρίαν.

> v.60: καὶ ἀποκριθεῖσα ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ εἶπεν· Οὐχί, ἀλλὰ κληθήσεται Ἰωάννης.

> v.63: καὶ αἰτήσας πινακίδιον ἔγραψεν λέγων· Ἰωάννης ἐστὶν ὄνομα αὐτοῦ. καὶ ἐθαύμασαν πάντες.

> v.64: ἀνεῴχθη δὲ τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ παραχρῆμα καὶ ἡ γλῶσσα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐλάλει εὐλογῶν τὸν θεόν.

### Literary Form
Birth narrative with recognition scene

### Translation Considerations

**Key Terms for Unchurched Readers:**

- **περιτεμεῖν** (peritamein): "to circumcise" — the covenant sign given to Abraham (Genesis 17), performed on the eighth day. For Jewish families, this was both religious obligation and identity marker.

- **πινακίδιον** (pinakidion): "writing tablet" — a small wooden board covered with wax; one would scratch letters with a stylus. Indicates Zechariah's literacy (priests were educated).

- **Ἰωάννης** (Iōannēs): "John" — from Hebrew יוֹחָנָן (Yochanan), meaning "YHWH has been gracious." The name itself proclaims God's grace.

### Commentary Synthesis

**Fitzmyer (Anchor Bible):** The naming scene creates dramatic tension. The neighbors assume the child will be named for his father or grandfather—standard practice. Elizabeth's insistence on "John" creates social friction: "None of your relatives has this name!" When the mute Zechariah writes the same name, the confirmation is supernatural.

**Bovon (Hermeneia):** Zechariah's first words after nine months of silence are praise (εὐλογῶν τὸν θεόν). His enforced silence has transformed him; when he speaks, he speaks blessing. The pattern of silence-then-prophetic-speech echoes Ezekiel (3:26-27; 24:27; 33:22).

**Bock (Baker):** The question "What then will this child be?" (v.66) hangs over the narrative. Luke raises expectations but delays fulfillment—John's destiny will only be revealed when he appears in the wilderness (3:1-6).

### Cultural Context

**Naming Customs:**
- Children were typically named at birth
- Evidence for naming at circumcision is late, but this text supports the practice
- Names often honored fathers or grandfathers
- The community expected to participate in naming—it was a social event
- Elizabeth's insistence on "John" was socially bold for a woman

**Circumcision:**
- Required on the eighth day (Leviticus 12:3), even if it fell on Sabbath
- Performed by the father in this period (later, professional mohels)
- A covenant sign marking membership in Israel
- Also a time for celebration—neighbors and relatives gathered

**The Question:**
"What then will this child be?" (τί ἄρα τὸ παιδίον τοῦτο ἔσται) — The community senses something extraordinary. The combination of miraculous birth, unusual name, and father's sudden speech creates awe and speculation. "The hand of the Lord was with him" (v.66b) confirms divine involvement without revealing details.

### Emotional Arc
The pericope moves from **communal joy** (neighbors celebrating the birth) through **social tension** (dispute over the name) to **astonished wonder** (Zechariah speaks, fear falls on all). The question in v.66 leaves readers in **suspense**—who will this child become?

### Translation Notes for Aperto Bible
- Circumcision will be unfamiliar to secular readers—brief explanation needed
- Elizabeth's "No!" (Οὐχί) is emphatic and socially bold
- Zechariah's written statement is dramatic: "John IS his name" (not "will be")—the name was already decided by God
- "Fear came on all" (φόβος) is not terror but religious awe

## Pericope 7: Zechariah's Prophecy / Benedictus (1:67-79)

### Greek Text (selected key verses)

> v.68: Εὐλογητὸς κύριος ὁ θεὸς τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι ἐπεσκέψατο καὶ ἐποίησεν λύτρωσιν τῷ λαῷ αὐτοῦ,

> v.69: καὶ ἤγειρεν κέρας σωτηρίας ἡμῖν ἐν οἴκῳ Δαυὶδ παιδὸς αὐτοῦ,

> v.72: ποιῆσαι ἔλεος μετὰ τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν καὶ μνησθῆναι διαθήκης ἁγίας αὐτοῦ,

> v.76-77: Καὶ σὺ δέ, παιδίον, προφήτης ὑψίστου κληθήσῃ· προπορεύσῃ γὰρ ἐνώπιον κυρίου ἑτοιμάσαι ὁδοὺς αὐτοῦ, τοῦ δοῦναι γνῶσιν σωτηρίας τῷ λαῷ αὐτοῦ ἐν ἀφέσει ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτῶν,

> v.78-79: διὰ σπλάγχνα ἐλέους θεοῦ ἡμῶν, ἐν οἷς ἐπισκέψεται ἡμᾶς ἀνατολὴ ἐξ ὕψους, ἐπιφᾶναι τοῖς ἐν σκότει καὶ σκιᾷ θανάτου καθημένοις, τοῦ κατευθῦναι τοὺς πόδας ἡμῶν εἰς ὁδὸν εἰρήνης.

- **Εὐλογητός** (eulogētos): "Blessed be" — standard opening for Jewish blessings (berakot). Not asking God to bless but declaring that God is worthy of blessing/praise.

- **ἐπεσκέψατο** (epeskepsato): "visited" — in biblical idiom, a divine "visitation" means God acting decisively in history, for salvation or judgment.

- **λύτρωσιν** (lytrōsin): "redemption" — originally the price paid to free a slave or prisoner. The exodus was Israel's paradigmatic redemption.

- **κέρας σωτηρίας** (keras sōtērias): "horn of salvation" — animal horn as symbol of strength and power. A "horn of salvation" is a powerful deliverer (cf. Psalm 18:2).

- **διαθήκης** (diathēkēs): "covenant" — 
  - BDAG: "As a transl. of בְּרִית in LXX δ. retains the component of legal disposition of personal goods while omitting that of the anticipated death of a testator... In the 'covenants' of God, it was God alone who set the conditions"
  - God's binding commitment to his people, especially the promises to Abraham

- **ἀνατολὴ ἐξ ὕψους** (anatolē ex hypsous): "rising/dawn from on high" — Could mean (1) sunrise/dayspring (messianic light), (2) the "Branch" (messianic title from Jeremiah 23:5, Zechariah 3:8, 6:12). Probably a deliberate double meaning.

- **σπλάγχνα ἐλέους** (splanchna eleous): "bowels/guts of mercy" — visceral compassion. Ancients located emotions in the internal organs. God's mercy is not abstract but gut-level.

### Commentary Synthesis

**Fitzmyer (Anchor Bible):** The Benedictus has two parts: vv.68-75 (praise for God's salvation through the Davidic Messiah) and vv.76-79 (prophecy about John's role as forerunner). The shift from third person ("he") to second person ("you, child") marks the division. The song is saturated with OT language—almost every phrase echoes Scripture.

**Bovon (Hermeneia):** The Benedictus presents salvation in political terms (enemies, those who hate us) that the Gospel will reinterpret. Israel expected military deliverance; Jesus will offer a different kind of rescue. John's role is to prepare the way—he gives "knowledge of salvation" through forgiveness of sins, not through military victory.

**Bock (Baker):** The covenant with Abraham (vv.72-73) is central. God's faithfulness spans generations—from Abraham to David to the present. The "holy covenant" and "oath sworn to Abraham" ground the entire narrative in promise and fulfillment.

**Keener (IVP Background):** "Blessed be God" opens Jewish prayers (cf. Psalm 41:13, 72:18). "Horn of salvation" echoes David's own words (Psalm 18:2). "Sunrise from on high" may allude to Malachi 4:2, the "sun of righteousness" in the context of Elijah's return.

### Cultural Context

**Covenant Theology:**
- God's oath to Abraham (Genesis 22:16-18) included descendants, land, and blessing to nations
- The Davidic covenant (2 Samuel 7) promised an eternal kingdom
- Zechariah sees these covenants being fulfilled in the events unfolding
- "To remember the covenant" means God acting on his promises

**Salvation Expectations:**
- First-century Jews expected deliverance from Roman occupation
- "Enemies" and "those who hate us" (v.71) would naturally mean political oppressors
- The Benedictus affirms this hope but Luke's Gospel will redefine what "salvation" means
- Note the shift in vv.77-79: salvation comes through forgiveness, light, and peace

**The Forerunner:**
- John will be "prophet of the Most High" (v.76)—highest prophetic status
- His role: prepare the Lord's way (Isaiah 40:3), give knowledge of salvation
- The forgiveness theme connects to John's later baptism ministry (3:3)

### Emotional Arc
The Benedictus moves from **erupting praise** (Zechariah's first words after nine months) through **covenant memory** (God has been faithful across centuries) to **tender hope** (addressing his newborn son). The final image—light dawning on those in darkness, feet guided to peace—is both cosmic and intimate.

### Translation Notes for Aperto Bible
- "Blessed be the Lord" is liturgical; consider "Praise the Lord, Israel's God!" for freshness
- "Horn of salvation" is opaque; consider "powerful Savior" or "mighty Rescuer"
- "Visited" needs context—God showing up to act
- The political/military language (enemies, rescue) is real but reinterpreted by the Gospel
- "Sunrise from on high" is beautiful and should stay poetic—perhaps "the dawn from heaven"
- "Shadow of death" (σκιᾷ θανάτου) echoes Psalm 23:4 ("valley of the shadow of death")

## Pericope 8: Growing Up in the Wilderness (1:80)

### Greek Text

> Τὸ δὲ παιδίον ηὔξανεν καὶ ἐκραταιοῦτο πνεύματι, καὶ ἦν ἐν ταῖς ἐρήμοις ἕως ἡμέρας ἀναδείξεως αὐτοῦ πρὸς τὸν Ἰσραήλ.

### Literary Form
Summary/transition statement

### Translation Considerations

**Key Terms for Unchurched Readers:**

- **ηὔξανεν καὶ ἐκραταιοῦτο** (ēuxanen kai ekrataiouto): "grew and became strong" — standard formula for childhood development (cf. 2:40 for Jesus; 1 Samuel 2:26 for Samuel).

- **πνεύματι** (pneumati): "in spirit" — could mean human spirit (inner strength) or Holy Spirit (divinely empowered). Given 1:15 (filled with Spirit from womb), probably both.

- **ἐρήμοις** (erēmois): "wilderness/desert regions" — not barren wasteland but sparsely populated areas. The Judean wilderness between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea was inhabited by various groups.

- **ἀναδείξεως** (anadeixeōs): "manifestation/public appearance" — the moment John steps onto the public stage (Luke 3:1-6).

### Commentary Synthesis

**Fitzmyer (Anchor Bible):** The verse is a Lukan summary bridging infancy and public ministry (cf. 2:40, 52 for Jesus). John's time "in the wilderness" connects to Isaiah 40:3—the forerunner's voice cries from the desert. The delay until "the day of his manifestation" heightens anticipation.

**Bovon (Hermeneia):** The wilderness evokes exodus typology—Israel was formed in the wilderness, and prophetic renewal movements often emerged from desert regions. John's withdrawal suggests preparation and separation from corrupted religious institutions.

**Keener (IVP Background):** The Essene community at Qumran (Dead Sea Scrolls) lived in this wilderness, preparing for God's coming through ritual purity and study. John's aged parents may have died before he reached adulthood—the Essenes reportedly adopted orphans. Whether John had Essene connections is debated; his later public ministry differed from their secluded lifestyle.

### Cultural Context

**The Wilderness:**
- The Judean wilderness stretches from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea
- Rocky, mountainous terrain with some seasonal vegetation
- Home to various communities seeking purity (Essenes) or escape (bandits)
- Theologically significant: place of testing (Jesus' temptation), revelation (Moses), and new beginnings

**John's Formation:**
- If Zechariah and Elizabeth died while John was young, who raised him?
- Some speculate Essene communities; others, extended family
- Luke leaves this mysterious—the wilderness itself forms the prophet
- His later appearance (3:1-6) continues wilderness themes

### Emotional Arc
This single verse creates **expectant pause**. We've heard extraordinary prophecies about John; now we wait. He grows in obscurity, hidden in the wilderness, until "the day of his manifestation." The reader is left in anticipation.

### Translation Notes for Aperto Bible
- "Grew and became strong in spirit" should feel like natural childhood development, not supernatural transformation
- "Wilderness" should evoke remoteness and preparation, not abandonment
- "Public appearance" captures ἀνάδειξις better than "showing forth"
- This verse is a bridge—translate it as such, not as a climax

## Cross-Pericope Themes

### 1. The Great Reversal
Throughout Luke 1, social hierarchies are inverted:
- An elderly, barren woman conceives
- A teenage peasant girl becomes mother of the Messiah
- A muted priest becomes a prophet
- The proud are scattered, rulers dethroned, the rich sent away empty
- The lowly are lifted up, the hungry filled

This theme will continue throughout Luke's Gospel (6:20-26; 14:11; 16:19-31; 18:14).

### 2. Women as Theological Agents
Luke 1 features women in unprecedented roles:
- Elizabeth prophesies and blesses (1:41-45)
- Mary receives direct angelic revelation (1:26-38)
- Mary delivers prophetic poetry about divine revolution (1:46-55)
- Both women recognize Jesus' significance before any man does

This challenges both ancient patriarchy and modern assumptions about biblical texts.

### 3. Spirit and Prophecy
The Holy Spirit appears prominently:
- John filled with Spirit from the womb (1:15)
- Elizabeth filled with Spirit to prophesy (1:41)
- Mary overshadowed by Spirit (1:35)
- Zechariah filled with Spirit to prophesy (1:67)

Luke presents the Spirit as the agent of prophetic revelation and new creation.

### 4. Promise and Fulfillment
Luke 1 is saturated with Scripture:
- Birth announcements echo Sarah, Hannah, Samson's mother
- Davidic promises (2 Samuel 7) find fulfillment
- Abrahamic covenant (Genesis 22) is remembered
- Prophetic hopes (Isaiah 40, Malachi 3-4) are realized

The new events don't replace Israel's story but fulfill it.

### 5. The Clash of Kingdoms
Herod the Great rules Judea (1:5), but another king is coming. The Roman Empire appears in chapter 2; the entire narrative unfolds under Caesar's shadow. Yet the Magnificat declares that true power is being redistributed. Luke sets up a contrast that will climax at the cross.
